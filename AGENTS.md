## Project Overview

Asset MCP is a read-only Python MCP server for aggregating personal asset data
across Binance, OKX, moomoo OpenD, Longbridge, IBKR, on-chain wallets, manually
configured accounts, and manually recorded loan liabilities.
It exposes normalized asset data, USD-denominated net worth summaries, and
dashboard-ready grouping data to MCP-compatible clients.

The server must not trade, transfer, withdraw, scrape banks, automate Alipay, or
perform any other asset-moving operation.

## Tech Stack

- Python `>=3.10`
- `uv` for dependency management and command execution
- `mcp` / FastMCP for the stdio MCP server
- `httpx` and provider SDKs for external account integrations
- Public pricing data from CoinGecko (token USD), Jupiter (Solana SPL), and
  optionally Covalent (EVM token inventory)
- `pytest`, `pytest-asyncio`, and `respx` for tests

## Important Paths

- `src/asset_mcp/cli.py`: `asset-mcp` console entry. Defines the `init` and
  `serve` subcommands, config-path resolution, and the `--force` / `--path`
  flags.
- `src/asset_mcp/server.py`: MCP tool definitions and server entry point.
- `src/asset_mcp/service.py`: service layer used by MCP tools. Owns the
  `ProviderErrorCode` enum, the `PROCESS_ISOLATED_SOURCES` set, per-provider
  timeout dispatch, and the thread-vs-subprocess decision.
- `src/asset_mcp/domain/aggregation.py`: asset grouping and summary logic.
- `src/asset_mcp/domain/models.py`: normalized domain models.
- `src/asset_mcp/domain/loans.py`: converts positive loan configuration into
  borrower-attributed negative assets using current same-symbol prices.
- `src/asset_mcp/config/`: YAML config parsing, config models, validation, and
  redaction.
- `src/asset_mcp/templates/config.local.yaml`: the template `asset-mcp init`
  copies into the user's config directory. Must stay in sync with the
  top-level `config.example.yaml` — update both together.
- `src/asset_mcp/providers/registry.py`: source-to-provider factory registry.
- `src/asset_mcp/providers/stdio.py`: `redirect_sdk_stdout()` helper that
  redirects file descriptor 1 around SDK calls; required for any provider
  whose SDK can emit native stdout.
- `src/asset_mcp/providers/exchanges/`: crypto exchange providers such as
  Binance and OKX.
- `src/asset_mcp/providers/brokerages/`: brokerage providers such as moomoo,
  Longbridge, and IBKR.
- `src/asset_mcp/providers/onchain/`: on-chain wallet provider and
  chain-specific packages.
- `src/asset_mcp/providers/manual/`: manually configured asset provider.
- `src/asset_mcp/aggregation.py`, `src/asset_mcp/models.py`, and legacy
  `src/asset_mcp/providers/*.py` modules: compatibility re-exports for older
  imports. Prefer the package paths above for new code.
- `tests/config/`: config parser and validation regression tests.
- `tests/domain/`: domain model, filtering, and aggregation regression tests.
- `tests/providers/`: provider parsing, stdout hygiene, and fake-client
  integration tests.
- `config.example.yaml`: safe example config, mirrors the `init` template. Do
  not put real secrets here.

## Development Commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev
```

Install all optional provider dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --extra dev --extra moomoo --extra longbridge
```

Run tests:

```bash
uv run pytest
```

Run a syntax check:

```bash
uv run python -m compileall src tests
```

Run the server with the example config:

```bash
ASSET_MCP_CONFIG=config.example.yaml uv run asset-mcp
```

## Code Guidelines

- Prefer existing provider and service patterns before adding new abstractions.
- Register new providers in `src/asset_mcp/providers/registry.py`; do not grow
  provider construction logic inside `src/asset_mcp/service.py`.
- Put crypto exchange integrations under `providers/exchanges/`, brokerage
  integrations under `providers/brokerages/`, on-chain logic under
  `providers/onchain/`, and manual sources under `providers/manual/`.
- Keep compatibility re-export modules small; platform implementation should
  live in the grouped provider package.
- Keep provider integrations read-only.
- Keep loan liabilities read-only: configuration may record borrower, symbol,
  quantity, and enabled state, but must never initiate lending, transfers, or repayment.
- Preserve normalized response shapes used by MCP tools unless the
  caller-facing contract is intentionally changed and tests are updated.
- Add or update tests for behavior changes, provider parsing changes, config
  validation changes, and regression fixes.
- When adding support for a new exchange, broker, manual source type, or
  other platform, update `README.md` (including the relevant Configure
  subsection with a YAML example), `AGENTS.md`, and any optional extra in
  `pyproject.toml` together in the same change.
- When the config schema changes, update `config.example.yaml` and
  `src/asset_mcp/templates/config.local.yaml` together so `asset-mcp init`
  produces a template that matches the documented example.
- Use structured parsing and typed models instead of ad hoc string handling
  when the codebase already has a suitable helper.
- Keep edits scoped. Do not rewrite unrelated provider, config, or
  aggregation code while making a targeted change.
- The checked-in tests should be runnable by a new contributor with
  `uv sync --extra dev` and `uv run pytest`. Do not require real API keys,
  `config.local.yaml`, a running broker app, or live network access for
  ordinary regression tests.

## MCP Tool Contract

The server exposes four MCP tools registered in `src/asset_mcp/server.py`:

- `get_net_worth`
- `get_assets` (optional filters: `source`, `accountId`, `category`)
- `get_asset_dashboard_data`
- `health_check_sources`

Tool names, response shapes, and filter parameters are public contract.
Changes that break callers require coordinated updates to `README.md`,
`AGENTS.md`, and the corresponding tests in `tests/providers/` and
`tests/domain/`.

`providerErrors[]` carries stable machine-readable codes defined by the
`ProviderErrorCode` enum in `src/asset_mcp/service.py`:

- `provider_timeout` — provider exceeded its per-provider timeout (retryable).
- `provider_exception` — provider raised an exception. Raw exception messages
  are sanitized in `service.py` before they reach the client; do not leak
  credentials or raw SDK strings.
- `provider_exited` — a subprocess-isolated provider exited without returning
  a result (retryable).

When adding a new provider, map its failure modes into one of these codes
rather than introducing a new one.

## Subprocess-isolated providers

`PROCESS_ISOLATED_SOURCES` in `src/asset_mcp/service.py` lists the providers
that run in a separate `spawn`-context process instead of an asyncio thread:

- `moomoo`
- `longbridge`

These SDKs can block on internal locks, spawn their own background threads,
or write to file descriptor 1 from native code — none of which can be safely
contained inside the MCP server process. Subprocess isolation lets the
service kill the worker on timeout without corrupting the stdio JSON-RPC
stream.

When adding a new provider whose SDK shares those traits:

- Add its source name to `PROCESS_ISOLATED_SOURCES`.
- Ensure the account config and any helper objects passed to the worker are
  picklable (the `spawn` start method requires this).
- Pair the change with a `provider_exited` regression path so timeouts and
  hard crashes return a stable error code instead of hanging the MCP tool.

## Provider stdout Hygiene

The MCP server uses stdio transport, so `stdout` is reserved for JSON-RPC
protocol frames. Any banner, warning, permission table, progress line, or
native SDK log written to `stdout` can corrupt the MCP stream and surface in
clients as `Transport closed`.

When adding or changing a broker or exchange provider:

- Wrap all third-party SDK calls with
  `asset_mcp.providers.stdio.redirect_sdk_stdout()`.
- Assume SDKs may bypass `print()` and write directly to file descriptor 1
  from native code or background threads; `contextlib.redirect_stdout()`
  alone is not enough.
- Exercise every network/API path, not only health checks. Quote/market-data
  endpoints can emit permission tables even when account-balance endpoints
  are quiet.
- Add a regression test using `capfd` and `os.write(1, ...)` to prove
  provider calls leave `stdout` empty.

## Security Rules

- Do not commit `config.local.yaml`.
- Do not commit real API keys, secrets, passphrases, access tokens, account
  numbers, personal balances, or private account labels.
- Use read-only API permissions for external services wherever possible.
- Do not add withdrawal, transfer, trading, order placement, or account
  mutation behavior.
- Return sanitized errors from MCP tools. Avoid leaking credentials or raw
  provider exception messages that may contain sensitive data.

## Agent Notes

- Check `git status --short` before editing and preserve unrelated user
  changes.
- Prefer `rg` / `rg --files` for repo searches.
- Read `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, and relevant tests before changing
  public behavior.
- When a user reports a setup or runtime symptom (e.g. `Transport closed`,
  `configured: false`, `partial: true`), check the README's Troubleshooting
  section first — the documented symptoms map to known root causes.
- Run `uv run python -m compileall src tests` as a fast pre-flight syntax
  check, then `uv run pytest` before finalizing code changes.
